1. Functions are useful when you run the same code over and
over, you can change the function once and the change will be
reflected everywhere the function is used.
2. Code in a function executes when a function is called.
3. The "def" statement creates a function.
4. A function is all the code that is defined with the scope of
the "def" statement. A function call causes the defined function
to run the code.
5. There is one global scope in a python program, there are as
many local scopes as there are functions.
6. When a function call returns, variables in a local scope are
destroyed.
7. A return values is the value given by a completed function
to the place where the function was called. Return values can be 
part of an expression.
8. If a function doesn't have a return statement, it returns
None.
9. You can use the global value to force a function to use an
already defined global variable. global <variableName>
10. None represents the absence of a value. It is the only value
of the NoneType data type in Python.
11. import areallyourpetsnamederic; imports a module with the
name "areallyourpetsnamederic".
12. spam.bacon()
13. One way of exception handling is the try except method. The
program will run the try block first and run the exception
block if the try block encounters an error
14. The expected or intended code goes in the Try clause and the 
error handling code goes in the Except clause.
15. random_number is defined outside the scope of the
get_random_dice_roll function, such that this same variable is
returned every time.
